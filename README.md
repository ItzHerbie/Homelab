<h2>ðŸ“š Why I'm Building This Home Lab</h2>

<p>
  Iâ€™m new to home labbing and currently in the early stages of my cybersecurity journey. This home lab is my personal learning environment where I can gain hands-on experience with cybersecurity tools and techniques.
</p>

<p>
  My main goals include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learning how to detect and respond to cyber threats.</li>
  <li>Understanding how to better protect networks and devices.</li>
  <li>Exploring tools and technologies used in real-world environments.</li>
  <li>Building a strong foundation through practical, hands-on learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This lab reflects my commitment to growing my skills and becoming more proficient in the field of cybersecurityâ€”one step, one tool, and one experiment at a time.
