<h2>📚 Why I'm Building This Home Lab</h2>

<p>
 I’m new to home labbing and this home lab is my personal learning environment where I can gain hands-on experience with cybersecurity tools and techniques.
</p>

<p>
  Some of the key tools I'm experimenting with include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Suricata</strong> – for network intrusion detection (NIDS).</li>
  <li><strong>Velociraptor</strong> – for endpoint monitoring, incident response, and artifact collection.</li>
  <li><strong>Syslog Server</strong> – to centralize and manage logs from multiple devices.</li>
  <li><strong>Elasticsearch</strong> – for indexing, searching, and analyzing security data.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  My goals for this lab are to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learn how to detect, analyze, and respond to threats.</li>
  <li>Understand how to harden networks and systems.</li>
  <li>Build familiarity with tools used in blue team operations.</li>
  <li>Develop real-world skills outside of classroom theory.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This lab is a work in progress, and I'm sharing what I learn along the way. If you're also new to cybersecurity or home labs, I hope this project helps you too!
